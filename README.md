# GeoPoint-Closest-Finder-GUI
This project is a Python application that allows users to find the closest geographical point to their location based on a file of pre-defined points. The program demonstrates the use of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using **wxPython** and incorporates classes and functions from a previous assignment.
